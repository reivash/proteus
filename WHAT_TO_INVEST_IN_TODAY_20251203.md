| MU | $236 | $212 (-10%) | -$24/share |

### Exit Signals
1. Score drops a full tier (e.g., Strong → Moderate)
2. Revenue growth decelerates 2+ consecutive quarters
3. Gross margin compression >500 bps
4. Key customer losses

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Today's Best Opportunity: MICRON (MU)**

MU offers the best risk/reward today because:
1. Clear earnings catalyst (Dec 17)
2. Massive Japan investment validates HBM thesis
3. $338 target = 43% upside from current price
4. AI memory supercycle narrative strengthening
5. Portfolio optimization shows 85% optimal weight

**Second Best: ALAB on momentum, PLTR on the dip**

The December seasonality and likely Fed rate cut create a favorable backdrop. However, maintain discipline with position sizing and don't chase extended names.
