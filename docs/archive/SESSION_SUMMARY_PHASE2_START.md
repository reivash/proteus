---

## KEY INSIGHTS THIS SESSION

### 1. Monitoring is Now Automated

**Before:** Manual checking of prices, calculations
**After:** `python portfolio_monitor.py` gives complete dashboard
**Value:** Daily monitoring in 30 seconds vs 30 minutes

### 2. MU Moat is Wider Than Realized

**Discovery:** Competitive analysis revealed MU's position is STRONGER than initially assessed:
- Not just a good company, but part of **3-player global oligopoly**
- Barriers to entry so high ($15B+) that new competition is essentially impossible
- **Moat rating 8/10** - among the widest in technology sector

**Implication:** Even if DCF assumptions are conservative, MU has pricing power to exceed expectations

### 3. PLTR Risk Even Greater Than DCF Showed

**Current Status:**
- Price: $168.22
- RSI: 27.5 (OVERSOLD - extreme reading)
- Trend: DOWNTREND (getting worse)
- Wall Street: 16% bullish (SELL consensus)
- DCF: -78% overvalued

**Action Required:** If you hold PLTR, prepare to trim on ANY bounce. The combination of:
- Extreme overvaluation
- Wall Street bearishness
- Technical breakdown
- RSI 27.5 (while ominous, suggests bounce coming)

**Plan:** RSI this oversold typically bounces to 40-50 range (price $180-190). Use that bounce to TRIM position.
