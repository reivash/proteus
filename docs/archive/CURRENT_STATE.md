### PATIENT CASH: WAIT FOR PULLBACKS

```
CASH RESERVE: 50% ($5,000)

APP (AppLovin):
  Current: $621 (OVERVALUED -47%)
  Wait For: $500-550 (need -19% to -27% pullback)
  Quality: Excellent (82.0 score, CEO alpha +49.8%)
  Issue: Price vs value mismatch

PLTR (Palantir):
  Current: $169 (EXTREME OVERVALUATION -78%)
  Action: TRIM if holding (on bounce to $180-190)
  DO NOT BUY: Only 16% analyst bullish + -78% overvalued
  RSI 28.2 oversold suggests bounce coming

ALAB (Astera Labs):
  Current: $171 (OVERVALUED -65%)
  Wait For: $100-120 (need -42% to -52% pullback)
  Quality: Best management (81.2, CEO alpha +63.2%)
  Issue: Priced for perfection
```

### For Existing Holders - CRITICAL ACTION

**TRIM PLTR IMMEDIATELY ON BOUNCE:**
- Wall Street SELL consensus (16% bullish) is major red flag
- RSI 27.7 oversold suggests bounce to $180-190
- **When bounces: Trim from 18% → 10% allocation**
- If breaks $155: Further reduce to 5%
- This is the biggest portfolio risk identified
