## RECONCILING BACKTEST VS DCF

### The Paradox

**Backtest Results (Historical Performance):**
- APP: +265% over 12 months ✓
- PLTR: +203% over 12 months ✓
- MU: +113% over 12 months ✓
- ALAB: +69% over 12 months ✓

**DCF Results (Forward Valuation):**
- APP: -47% overvalued ⚠
- PLTR: -78% overvalued ⚠
- MU: +58% undervalued ✓
- ALAB: -64% overvalued ⚠

### The Explanation

**Both Are Correct!**

1. **Backtest validated our SCORING SYSTEM** - We successfully identified high-quality companies that would outperform

2. **DCF validates VALUATION CONCERNS** - After massive runs, most are now expensive

3. **Timing Matters:**
   - 12 months ago: All 4 were likely undervalued
   - Today: Only MU remains undervalued
   - Future: Need to wait for pullbacks in APP/PLTR/ALAB

**Investment Implication:**
- **For new money:** Focus on MU
- **For existing holders:** Consider taking profits on APP/PLTR/ALAB
- **For patient investors:** Set price alerts for APP ($400), PLTR ($100), ALAB ($80)

## DETAILED VALUATION ANALYSIS

### 1. MU (Micron) - STRONG BUY ✓

**Current Price:** $237.59
**Fair Value:** $375.20
**Upside:** **+57.9%**

#### DCF Assumptions

**Growth Assumptions:**
- Year 1: 40% (HBM ramp, sold out through 2026)
- Year 2: 30% (HBM3E production scaling)
- Year 3: 20% (Market share gains vs Samsung/SK Hynix)
- Year 4: 10% (Normalization as competition catches up)
- Year 5: 5% (Cyclical normalization)
- Terminal: 2% (GDP-like for cyclical semiconductor)

**Financial Inputs:**
- Base FCF: $17.53B (FY2025 operating cash flow)
- Discount Rate: 11% (cyclical risk premium)
- Net Debt: $5.05B
- Shares Outstanding: 1.13B

#### Valuation Breakdown

```
Present Value of 5-Year Cash Flows: $129.95B
Present Value of Terminal Value:    $297.33B
Enterprise Value:                    $427.27B
Less: Net Debt:                      $5.05B
Equity Value:                        $422.23B
÷ Shares Outstanding:                1.13B
= Fair Value Per Share:              $375.20
```

#### Why MU is Undervalued

**1. Market Hasn't Priced In HBM Boom**
- HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) sold out for entire 2026
- $8B HBM run rate growing rapidly
- Only 3 suppliers globally (MU, Samsung, SK Hynix)
- MU gaining share with HBM3E

**2. Margin Expansion Underappreciated**
- Gross margin: 22% (FY2024) → 51% (FY2026 guidance)
- Operating leverage kicking in
- HBM commands premium pricing (3-5x standard DRAM)

**3. Cyclical Discount Too Severe**
- Trading at 18.4x forward P/E
- Peers (NVDA, AMD) at 30-50x+
- This cycle different: AI memory demand structural, not cyclical

**4. Backtest Confirmed Quality**
- +120% over 3 months
- +196% over 6 months
- +113% over 12 months
- Consistent outperformance validates business quality

#### Investment Thesis

**[***] STRONG BUY - HIGHEST CONVICTION**

**Why Buy:**
1. DCF shows 58% upside (most in portfolio)
2. Wall Street consensus: 31/35 analysts Buy/Strong Buy
3. Street high price target: $338 (+42% from current)
4. HBM sold out provides revenue visibility
5. Earnings beat expectations (confirmed in validation)
6. Cheapest valuation despite strong growth

**Allocation Recommendation:** **35% of portfolio**

**Entry Strategy:**
- Buy aggressively at current levels ($237)
- Add on any dip to $220-230 range
- Set first profit target at $300 (+26%)
- Hold for $375+ fair value (+58%)

---

### 2. APP (AppLovin) - OVERVALUED ⚠

**Current Price:** $616.89
**Fair Value:** $326.18
**Downside:** **-47.1%**

#### DCF Assumptions

**Growth Assumptions:**
- Year 1: 30% (Axon 2.0 AI platform momentum)
- Year 2: 25% (E-commerce expansion)
- Year 3: 20% (International growth)
- Year 4: 15% (Market maturation)
- Year 5: 12% (Steady state growth)
- Terminal: 3% (Above GDP as category leader)

**Financial Inputs:**
- Base FCF: $3.40B (FY2025 operating cash flow)
- Discount Rate: 10% (high quality business)
- Net Debt: $1.85B
- Shares Outstanding: 0.31B

#### Valuation Breakdown

```
Present Value of 5-Year Cash Flows: $24.09B
Present Value of Terminal Value:    $78.08B
Enterprise Value:                    $102.18B
Less: Net Debt:                      $1.85B
Equity Value:                        $100.33B
÷ Shares Outstanding:                0.31B
= Fair Value Per Share:              $326.18
```

#### Why APP is Overvalued

**1. Already Had Massive Run**
- Up 265% over past 12 months
- Up 104% over past 6 months
- Up 56% over past 3 months
- Market has fully priced in AI advertising thesis

**2. High Expectations Baked In**
- Current valuation implies 30%+ growth for 5+ years
- Any slowdown would trigger multiple compression
- Competition risk from Google/Meta bundling

**3. Expensive Relative to Peers**
- Trading at premium valuations despite maturity
- P/E multiple expanded significantly

**4. Mean Reversion Risk**
- Parabolic move from $200 → $617 in 6 months
- Technical indicators extremely overbought
- Pullback to $400-500 range would be healthy

#### Nuanced View

**DCF May Be Conservative**

Our assumptions might understate:
- Axon 2.0 platform effect (could sustain 40%+ growth longer)
- E-commerce TAM expansion (larger opportunity than modeled)
- International growth potential (currently US-focused)
- Operating leverage (82% EBITDA margins could expand further)

**If growth sustains at 35%+ for 5 years, $600 valuation is justified.**

#### Investment Thesis

**[=] HOLD - Don't Buy, Don't Sell**

**For Existing Holders:**
- Hold current position (don't add)
- Set trailing stop at 20% below peak
- Take 50% profits if reaches $700+
- Consider trimming if exceeds 40% of portfolio

**For New Money:**
- **Wait for pullback to $400-450 range** (-27% to -35%)
- Set price alert at $450
- Only buy on significant dip

**Allocation Recommendation:**
- Current holders: 20-25% (maintain but don't increase)
- New money: 0% (wait for entry)

---

### 3. PLTR (Palantir) - MASSIVELY OVERVALUED ⚠

**Current Price:** $168.65
**Fair Value:** $36.53
**Downside:** **-78.3%**

#### DCF Assumptions

**Growth Assumptions:**
- Year 1: 45% (AIP platform, US commercial +93%)
- Year 2: 40% (Enterprise AI adoption accelerating)
- Year 3: 35% (Government contracts stable, commercial growing)
- Year 4: 30% (Market penetration deepening)
- Year 5: 25% (Sustained high growth)
- Terminal: 4% (Above GDP as platform leader)

**Financial Inputs:**
- Base FCF: $1.82B (FY2025 operating cash flow)
- Discount Rate: 12% (high valuation risk premium)
- Net Debt: -$6.20B (net cash position)

#### Valuation Breakdown

```
Present Value of 5-Year Cash Flows: $17.55B
Present Value of Terminal Value:    $59.71B
Enterprise Value:                    $77.25B
Plus: Net Cash:                      $6.20B
Equity Value:                        $83.45B
÷ Shares Outstanding:                2.28B
= Fair Value Per Share:              $36.53
```

#### Why PLTR is Massively Overvalued

**1. Most Expensive Stock in S&P 500**
- Current P/E: 666x (trailing)
- Forward P/E: 231x
- Needs 50%+ growth for 4+ years just to justify current price
- Any miss would trigger massive selloff

**2. Absurd Price Action**
- Up 203% over past 12 months
- Up 36% over past 6 months
- Market cap: $401B (larger than Intel, AMD)
- More expensive than any comp (Snowflake, Datadog, etc.)

**3. Even Aggressive Assumptions Don't Justify Price**
- We modeled 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25% growth
- Added 4% terminal growth (very optimistic)
- Still only get to $37 fair value vs $169 current

**4. Wall Street Agrees**
- 67% of analysts have HOLD rating (not Buy!)
- Consensus price target: $188 (+12% from current)
- Many cautioning on valuation

#### Why It Could Stay Overvalued

**The Bull Case:**

PLTR could stay expensive if:
1. AIP platform becomes category-defining (like Salesforce)
2. US commercial sustains 90%+ growth for years
3. Government AI spend explodes
4. Platform network effects create winner-take-all dynamic
5. Margin expansion beyond current 33%

**Growth stocks can trade at extreme valuations for years** (see TSLA, NVDA, SHOP in past).

**If PLTR sustains 50%+ growth for 5+ years, $200+ could be justified.**

#### Investment Thesis

**[-] REDUCE - Trim On Strength**

**For Existing Holders:**
- **Trim position to 15-20% of portfolio max**
- Set trailing stop at 25% below peak
- Take 75% profits if exceeds $180
- Don't hold more than 20% in single stock this expensive

**For New Money:**
- **DO NOT BUY at current levels**
- Wait for pullback to $120-140 range (-29% to -42%)
- Only consider if drops below $100 (-41%)
- Even then, limit to 10-15% allocation

**Allocation Recommendation:**
- Current holders: Reduce from 25% → 15-20%
- New money: 0% (wait for major pullback)

**Why Not Sell Everything?**
- Great company (validated by backtest)
- Could stay overvalued for extended period
- Missing continued upside would hurt
- Better to trim than exit completely

### 4. ALAB (Astera Labs) - OVERVALUED ⚠

**Current Price:** $166.03
**Fair Value:** $59.06
**Downside:** **-64.4%**

#### DCF Assumptions

**Growth Assumptions:**
- Year 1: 50% (AI connectivity chip demand)
- Year 2: 40% (NVIDIA partnership, cloud provider adoption)
- Year 3: 30% (Market penetration increasing)
- Year 4: 20% (Competition emerging)
- Year 5: 15% (Market normalization)
- Terminal: 3% (Niche leader maintaining above-GDP growth)

**Financial Inputs:**
- Base FCF: $0.26B (current year operating cash flow)
- Discount Rate: 12% (small cap risk premium)
- Net Debt: -$1.10B (net cash position)
- Shares Outstanding: 0.17B

#### Valuation Breakdown

```
Present Value of 5-Year Cash Flows: $2.42B
Present Value of Terminal Value:    $6.45B
Enterprise Value:                    $8.87B
Plus: Net Cash:                      $1.10B
Equity Value:                        $9.98B
÷ Shares Outstanding:                0.17B
= Fair Value Per Share:              $59.06
```

#### Why ALAB is Overvalued

**1. Recent IPO Momentum Fading**
- IPO'd at $36 in March 2024
- Ran to $166 (+361% in 9 months)
- Early enthusiasm wearing off
- Post-IPO lockup risks

**2. Small Base, High Multiple**
- Only $720M annual revenue
- $28B market cap = 39x revenue
- For comparison: NVDA at 22x revenue
- Must execute perfectly to justify valuation

**3. Competition Risk**
- Broadcom, Marvell, Cisco in connectivity space
- Larger players could bundle offerings
- NVIDIA could vertically integrate
- Niche could get commoditized

**4. Limited Analyst Coverage**
- Newer IPO, less institutional validation
- Fewer checks on valuation exuberance
- Retail-driven momentum could reverse quickly

#### Investment Thesis

**[-] REDUCE - Trim Position**

**For Existing Holders:**
- **Trim position to 10-12% of portfolio**
- Set stop loss at $140 (-15%)
- Take 50% profits if stays above $160
- Smaller company = higher volatility risk

**For New Money:**
- **Wait for pullback to $80-100 range** (-40% to -52%)
- Set price alert at $100
- Limit allocation to 10% max (higher risk)

**Allocation Recommendation:**
- Current holders: Reduce from 20% → 10-12%
- New money: 0% (wait for entry)

**Why Not Sell Everything?**
- Infrastructure play on AI boom (valid thesis)
- Profitable with high growth (rare)
- Backtest showed consistent performance (+130% over 6mo)
- Could continue if AI buildout accelerates

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### What If We're Wrong?

#### Scenario 1: Our Growth Assumptions Too Conservative

**Impact on Fair Values:**

| Stock | Base Case FV | +10% Growth FV | +20% Growth FV |
|-------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| MU | $375 | $456 (+22%) | $548 (+46%) |
| APP | $326 | $412 (+26%) | $518 (+59%) |
| PLTR | $37 | $52 (+41%) | $73 (+97%) |
| ALAB | $59 | $78 (+32%) | $103 (+74%) |

**Even with +20% higher growth, only APP reaches current price ($518 vs $617).**

#### Scenario 2: Market Multiple Compression

If market corrects and P/E multiples compress:

**Tech Selloff Impact (20% market correction):**
- MU: $237 → $190 (already cheap, limited downside)
- APP: $617 → $494 (overvalued stocks fall more)
- PLTR: $169 → $118 (extreme multiples compress most)
- ALAB: $166 → $116 (small caps hit hardest)

**After correction, entry points:**
- MU: Still undervalued at $190 (FV $375)
- APP: Fair value at $494 (FV $518 w/ higher growth)
- PLTR: Approaching fair value at $118 (FV $73-100)
- ALAB: Fair value at $116 (FV $103 w/ higher growth)

**Takeaway:** Market correction would create excellent entry points in APP/PLTR/ALAB.

## DCF METHODOLOGY & LIMITATIONS

### Our Approach

**5-Year Projection Model:**
1. Project Free Cash Flow for 5 years with declining growth rates
2. Calculate Terminal Value (perpetuity growth model)
3. Discount all cash flows to present value
4. Adjust for net debt/cash
5. Divide by shares outstanding

**Discount Rates Used:**
- APP: 10% (high quality, lower risk)
- MU: 11% (cyclical risk premium)
- PLTR: 12% (valuation risk premium)
- ALAB: 12% (small cap risk premium)

### Limitations of DCF

**1. Garbage In, Garbage Out**
- Valuation only as good as assumptions
- Small changes in growth/discount rate = big FV changes
- Hard to predict 5-10 years out for fast-growing companies

**2. Doesn't Capture Momentum**
- DCF is rational, markets aren't always rational
- Growth stocks can stay overvalued for years
- FOMO and narrative drive prices, not DCF

**3. Terminal Value Dominates**
- 60-75% of fair value comes from terminal value
- Terminal value is furthest from reality
- Changes to terminal growth rate swing valuation wildly

**4. Cyclical Complexity**
- MU is cyclical - peak FCF inflates valuation
- Should normalize for cycle, we didn't
- Could explain why MU looks "cheap"

### Why DCF Still Valuable

Despite limitations:
- **Forces rigorous thinking** about growth sustainability
- **Provides anchor point** vs emotional market prices
- **Highlights valuation risk** when upside is negative
- **Guides position sizing** (bigger positions in undervalued)

**Use DCF as ONE input, not the only input.**
