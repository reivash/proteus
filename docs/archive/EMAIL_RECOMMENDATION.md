## INVESTMENT CASE HIGHLIGHTS

### Why Micron NOW?

**1. Secular AI Tailwind (5-10 years)**
- HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for AI training SOLD OUT through 2026
- Data center expansion driving 50-60% CAGR in memory demand
- AI chip demand is SECULAR, not cyclical

**2. Oligopoly Market Structure**
- Only 3 global HBM suppliers: Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron
- Barriers to entry: $15B+ investment, 3-5 years development
- Rational pricing, sustainable margins (22% → 51% expansion)

**3. Significant Undervaluation**
- Trading at $240 vs $375 DCF fair value (+58% upside)
- Forward P/E: 18.4x (cheap for semiconductor with 46% growth)
- Wall Street avg target: $291 (+21% from current)

**4. Technical Entry Confirmation**
- Strong uptrend since October 2024 lows
- RSI 44 (neutral, room to run)
- Currently in optimal entry zone $230-245
- Support at $230, resistance at $262

**5. Management Excellence**
- CEO Sanjay Mehrotra: +769% stock return, +13.8% annual alpha vs S&P
- Capital allocation: 85/100 (19% shareholder yield, $1.7B FCF)
- 40 years semiconductor experience

**6. Institutional Validation**
- 82.8% institutional ownership (very high conviction)
- Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street all major holders
- Top 10 institutions hold 43.1% (highest among comparable stocks)

## PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS

**Modern Portfolio Theory Validation:**
- Optimizer allocates **85% to MU** in semiconductor portfolio
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.618 (vs 1.049 equal-weight)
- +0.569 Sharpe improvement from optimization
- **Quantitative analysis confirms fundamental thesis**

Both fundamental analysis (10 layers) and quantitative optimization independently recommend heavy MU allocation.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Identified Risks & Mitigations:**

1. **Cyclical Downturn Risk (30% probability)**
   - Mitigation: AI demand is secular 5-10 years, overrides cycles
   - HBM sold out through 2026 provides visibility

2. **Competition Flooding Market (20% probability)**
   - Mitigation: $15B+ barriers prevent new entrants
   - Only 3 players globally can produce HBM at scale

3. **Geopolitical Risk - China/Taiwan (Manageable)**
   - Mitigation: Diversified manufacturing (US, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore)
   - US CHIPS Act support ($6.1B grant to MU)
   - Export controls BENEFIT US companies vs Chinese competitors

4. **Execution Risk (Low)**
   - Mitigation: Strong management track record
   - Margin expansion proves operational excellence

**Overall Risk Rating:** MODERATE (appropriate for 50% allocation)

---

## PROJECTED RETURNS BY SCENARIO

**Base Case (60% probability):** +56.2% to DCF fair value ($375)
- Timeframe: 12-24 months
- Assumes: AI demand continues, margins stable

**Bull Case (25% probability):** +80-100% to $430-480
- Timeframe: 18-30 months
- Assumes: AI demand accelerates, HBM pricing power exceeds expectations

**Bear Case (15% probability):** -8% to stop loss ($220)
- Timeframe: N/A (exit immediately if triggered)
- Assumes: Unexpected cyclical downturn or execution miss

**Expected Value (probability-weighted):**
- (0.60 × 56.2%) + (0.25 × 90%) + (0.15 × -8%) = **55.1% expected return**
