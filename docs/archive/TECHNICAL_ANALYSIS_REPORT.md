- DCF fair value $326 vs $619 current

**DO NOT Buy at Current Levels ($619)**

**Wait for Pullback:**

**Tier 1 Entry:** $500-550 (-10% to -19%)
- Tests 50-day MA ($608) and breaks below
- RSI drops to 35-40 (oversold)
- Would still be expensive vs DCF, but better risk/reward

**Tier 2 Entry:** $450-500 (-20% to -27%)
- Tests 200-day MA ($428)
- Approaching DCF fair value territory
- **Best entry zone fundamentally**

**Tier 3 Entry:** $400-450 (-27% to -35%)
- Below 200-day MA (correction territory)

- Would be compelling buy

- Alert 3: $450 (strong buy zone)

**For Current Holders:**

### 3. PLTR (Palantir) - Oversold, But Overvalued

**Current Price:** $168.54
**DCF Fair Value:** $36.53 (-78.3% overvalued)

#### Technical Setup

**Trend:** SIDEWAYS (was uptrend) ⚠
- Recently broke below MA20 and MA50
- Still above MA200 by 19.7%
- 20-day ROC: **-18.7%** (sharp pullback!)

**Momentum Indicators:**
- RSI: **27.7** (OVERSOLD! Extreme reading)
- MACD: BEARISH (below signal)
- Volume: 75% below average (low conviction selling)

**Support & Resistance:**
- **Resistance:** $190.00 (+12.7%) ← Previous support now resistance
- **Current:** $168.54
- **Support:** $142.34 (-15.5%) ← Next support level

**Chart Pattern:**
- Was in strong uptrend (hit $213 high)
- Broke down from $190 level (loss of support)
- Down 21% from peak in 3 weeks
- RSI 27.7 = extremely oversold (usually bounces)

#### The Dilemma

**Technical Says:** OVERSOLD - Could Bounce
- RSI 27.7 is extreme (typically bounces at 30)
- Down 19% in 20 days (sharp selloff)
- Low volume (capitulation?)

**Fundamental Says:** MASSIVELY OVERVALUED
- DCF fair value $37 vs $169 current
- Forward P/E 231x (most expensive in S&P 500)
- Needs 50%+ growth for years to justify price

#### Entry Strategy

**Three Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Tactical Bounce Trade (High Risk)**
- Buy small position $165-170 for bounce
- Target: $180-190 (10-15% bounce)
- Stop loss: $158 (-6%)
- **Risk:** Could be "catching a falling knife"
- **For:** Experienced traders only

**Scenario 2: Wait for Breakdown (Patient)**
- If breaks below $142 support, wait for $120-140 range
- Still expensive at $140 (DCF $37) but better R/R
- Would be 35-50% down from current
- **Target entry:** $120-140

**Scenario 3: Wait for Extreme Correction (Very Patient)**
- Wait for $80-100 range (50-60% correction)
- Closer to realistic valuation
- Could take 1-2 years
- **Target entry:** $80-100

**For Current Holders:**
- RSI 27.7 suggests bounce likely
- Could bounce to $180-190
- **Action:** Hold for bounce, then reassess
- Set stop loss at $155 (-8%)

**Verdict:** [=] **HOLD current, wait if new money** - Oversold but overvalued

---

### 4. ALAB (Astera Labs) - Neutral Setup, Wait

#### Technical Setup

**Trend:** SIDEWAYS ⚠

**Momentum Indicators:**
- RSI: 46.0 (neutral)
- MACD: BULLISH (but weak)
- Volume: 53% below average (low conviction)

**Support & Resistance:**
- **Resistance:** $262.90 (+56.6%) ← IPO peak

**Chart Pattern:**
- IPO'd at $36 in March 2024
- Ran to $263 peak (+631%)
- Pulled back to $168 (36% off highs)
- Range-bound $150-190 for 2 months

#### The Situation

- Low volume (indecision)
- Could break either direction

**Fundamental Says:** OVERVALUED
- DCF fair value $59 vs $168 current
- Recent IPO momentum fading
- Competition risks

#### Entry Strategy

**DO NOT Buy at Current Levels ($168)**

**Wait for Clearer Signal:**

**Breakout Scenario (If bullish):**
- If breaks above $190 with volume
- Could retest $220-240 range
- **Not recommended** - fundamentally expensive

**Breakdown Scenario (Preferred):**
- If breaks below $151 support
- Target: $120-140 range (-28% to -43%)
- **Entry zone:** $100-120 (closer to DCF)

**Best Entry:** $80-100 (-40% to -52%)
- Near DCF fair value ($59)
- After significant correction
- Better risk/reward

**For Current Holders:**
- Set stop loss at $150 (-11%)
