## BUYING STRATEGY

### DO NOT Buy All at Once!

**Week 1: Buy 25% of target positions**

- Use limit orders 2-3% below current price

**Week 2: Buy another 25%**
- Add CRWV, MRVL if in your strategy
- Market orders if limit orders didn't fill

**Week 3: Buy another 25%**
- Add tier 3 holdings (ARM, TEM, IONQ)
- Continue dollar-cost averaging

**Week 4: Buy final 25%**
- Complete all positions
- Adjust based on what filled

**Why Dollar-Cost Average:**
- Reduces timing risk
- Better average price
- Psychologically easier
- Proven strategy

## FAQ

**Q: Should I buy NVDA even though it's $4.4T market cap?**
A: Yes if you want stability. It's the AI leader. But APP/PLTR/MU offer better growth potential.

**Q: Why is APP so expensive at $605?**
A: 77% operating margin + 68% growth justifies it. Quality costs more.

**Q: Is MU really a good buy after +141% YTD?**
A: Yes! Forward P/E is only 18.4x, still cheap for 46% growth. HBM4 demand is accelerating.

**Q: Should I avoid FIG since it's down 70%?**
A: Yes unless you're speculating. 49.6 score is borderline, high risk.

**Q: Can I just buy the top 3 and forget it?**
A: Yes! APP + PLTR + MU is a fantastic core. Rebalance quarterly.

**Q: What about international AI companies?**
A: This guide focuses on US stocks. TSM (Taiwan) is excellent but adds currency risk.

**Q: When will you update scores?**
A: Run analysis scripts quarterly or check `data/score_history.json` for latest.

**Q: Should I sell CRWD/ZS/DDOG even though they've done well?**
A: Hold what you have (proven track record) but don't add new money. Better opportunities in top tier.
