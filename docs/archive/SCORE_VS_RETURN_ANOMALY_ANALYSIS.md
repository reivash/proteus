# The Score vs Return Anomaly: Why Do Some Moderate Scores Win Big?
**Analysis of CRWD, ZS, DDOG - Moderate Scores, Exceptional Returns**

---

## 🎯 THE PARADOX

Three companies with **moderate scores (40-45/100)** have delivered **exceptional returns (+326% to +778%)**:

| Company | Score | Tier | Return | Market Cap | Years Since IPO |
|---------|-------|------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **CRWD** | 40.8 | Moderate | **+778%** | $128B | 6.5 years |
| **ZS** | 43.2 | Moderate | **+662%** | $40B | 7.75 years |
| **DDOG** | 45.4 | Moderate | **+326%** | $56B | 6.25 years |

**Average Return:** +589% (comparable to top-tier PLTR at +1,673%)

**The Question:** Why did our scoring system rate them moderate, yet they became massive winners?

**The Implication:** Are we missing something important? Should we adjust our methodology?

## 📊 SCORING BREAKDOWN

### Why They Score "Moderate"

**CRWD (40.8/100):**
- Base YC Score: 45.2/100
- Competitive Score: 40.0/100
- Trajectory Score: 36.0/100

**Weaknesses in Scoring:**
- Revenue growth slowing: 21.3% YoY (down from 60%+ earlier)
- High market cap: $128B (already large, less room to grow)

## 🔍 WHAT OUR SCORING SYSTEM PENALIZES

### Factor 1: Growth Deceleration
All three have **slowing growth** compared to earlier years:

**CRWD Growth History:**
- 2019: 110% YoY
- 2020: 82% YoY
- 2021: 67% YoY
- 2022: 54% YoY
- 2023: 37% YoY
- 2024: 21.3% YoY ← Current (penalized)

**Pattern:** Our scoring system penalizes for current slow growth, but doesn't fully reward for **past exceptional execution**.

### Factor 2: Market Cap Size
- CRWD: $128B (already mega-cap)
- ZS: $40B (large-cap)
- DDOG: $56B (large-cap)

**Pattern:** Our trajectory scoring considers **lower upside potential** for large companies.

### Factor 3: Competitive Positioning
- None are clear category leaders (CRWD #2, ZS #3, DDOG #2)
- Lower market share vs PLTR (34.7%)
- Competitive moat scores 15-40/100 (vs PLTR's 80/100)

**Pattern:** Our scoring heavily weights **dominant market position**, which these don't have.

---

## 💡 WHAT OUR SCORING SYSTEM MISSED (OR UNDERWEIGHTED)

### Factor 1: **Exceptional Historical Execution**

**What We Missed:**
- CRWD: 6.5 years of consistent 50-110% growth
- ZS: 7.75 years of consistent 40-80% growth
- DDOG: 6.25 years of consistent 50-80% growth

**Why It Matters:**
- Demonstrates management excellence
- Proves business model resilience
- Shows ability to scale efficiently
- Market rewards **track record** heavily

**Current Scoring Weight:** ~30% (Trajectory Score)
**Should Be:** ~40% (increase by 10pp)

**Recommendation:** Add "Historical Execution Score" component:
- Years of consistent growth (uninterrupted)
- Margin expansion over time
- Customer retention trends
- Management team stability

---

### Factor 2: **Market Leadership in Growing Niches**

**What We Missed:**
- CRWD: Category creator in **cloud-native endpoint security**
- ZS: Category creator in **zero trust network access**
- DDOG: Category creator in **observability/APM**

**Why It Matters:**
- Created new categories, not just competing in existing ones
- First-mover advantages compound over time
- "Category King" effect: market consolidates to leader
- Expanding TAM as category grows

**Current Scoring:** Captured in competitive positioning, but underweighted
**Should Be:** Add "Category Creation" bonus (+10 points)

**Recommendation:** Distinguish between:
- **Competing in existing category** (0 bonus)
- **Leading established category** (+5 points)
- **Creating new category** (+10 points)

---

### Factor 3: **"Rule of 40" and Efficient Growth**

**Rule of 40:** Revenue Growth % + Operating Margin % should exceed 40%

**Performance:**

| Company | Revenue Growth | Operating Margin | Rule of 40 | Status |
|---------|---------------|------------------|------------|--------|
| **CRWD** | 21.3% | ~15% | **36.3%** | Near target |
| **ZS** | 25.5% | ~5% | **30.5%** | Below target |
| **DDOG** | 28.4% | ~10% | **38.4%** | Near target |

**For Comparison:**
| Company | Revenue Growth | Operating Margin | Rule of 40 |
|---------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| **PLTR** | 62.8% | 33.3% | **96.1%** | Exceptional |
| **ALAB** | 103.9% | 24.0% | **127.9%** | Exceptional |
| **CRWV** | 133.7% | 3.8% | **137.5%** | Exceptional |

**Insight:** CRWD/ZS/DDOG are **efficient growers** (Rule of 40 near 30-40%), but not exceptional (60-100%+).

**Current Scoring:** Indirectly captured in profitability + growth components
**Should Be:** Explicitly calculate and weight Rule of 40 score

**Recommendation:** Add Rule of 40 scoring tier:
- **100+:** Exceptional (+15 points)
- **60-100:** Very Strong (+10 points)
- **40-60:** Strong (+5 points)
- **30-40:** Adequate (0 points)
- **<30:** Weak (-5 points)

---

### Factor 4: **Recurring Revenue Durability**

**What We Missed:**
- All three have **subscription SaaS** with 95%+ retention
- Net Revenue Retention >120% (customers expanding usage)
- Mission-critical infrastructure (can't easily rip out)
- **Compounding revenue base**

**CRWD Metrics:**
- Dollar-Based Net Retention: 119%
- Annual Recurring Revenue: $3.4B
- Subscription Model: 96% of revenue

**ZS Metrics:**
- Dollar-Based Net Retention: 125%
- Subscription Model: 99% of revenue

**DDOG Metrics:**
- Dollar-Based Net Retention: 130%
- Subscription Model: 99% of revenue

**Why It Matters:**
- **Compounding:** Each year builds on previous year
- **Predictability:** High visibility into future revenue
- **Moat:** High switching costs once integrated
- **Valuation:** Market values recurring revenue at premium

**Current Scoring:** Indirectly in scaling score
**Should Be:** Add explicit "Revenue Quality" component

**Recommendation:** Score based on:
- Subscription % of revenue (>95% = +5 points)
- Net Revenue Retention (>120% = +5 points)
- Gross Retention (>90% = +5 points)
- Maximum: +15 points for "gold standard" SaaS metrics

---

### Factor 5: **Scale Advantages Kicking In**

**What We Missed:**
- At $128B (CRWD), $40B (ZS), $56B (DDOG), they have **massive scale advantages**
- Brand recognition: Top-of-mind for buyers
- Ecosystem effects: Integration partners, certifications
- Data moat: More customers = more threat data = better product
- Sales efficiency: Inbound leads, word-of-mouth

**Evidence:**
- CRWD Magic Quadrant Leader (Gartner)
- ZS Zero Trust Leader
- DDOG Observability Leader

**Why It Matters:**
- **Winner-take-most dynamics** in enterprise software
- Harder for competitors to dislodge at scale
- Operating leverage improves (margins expand)

**Current Scoring:** Partially captured in competitive moat
**Should Be:** Add "Scale Benefits" score based on market cap tiers

**Recommendation:**
- **$100B+:** Mega-scale advantages (+10 points)
- **$50-100B:** Large-scale advantages (+7 points)
- **$20-50B:** Mid-scale advantages (+5 points)
- **$10-20B:** Early-scale advantages (+3 points)
- **<$10B:** No scale advantages (0 points)

---

### Factor 6: **Market Timing and Secular Trends**

**What We Missed:**
- All three rode **major secular trends**:
  - **CRWD:** Cloud migration + remote work + ransomware explosion
  - **ZS:** Zero trust architecture + SASE (Secure Access Service Edge)
  - **DDOG:** Cloud-native apps + microservices + DevOps

**Why It Matters:**
- Tailwinds > Headwinds = multi-year growth
- Market expands faster than company grows
- Rising tide lifts all boats

**Current Scoring:** Captured in TAM expansion (3x)
**Insight:** Our TAM scoring (3x) may be **too conservative** for these mega-trends

**Recommendation:** Distinguish TAM expansion types:
- **Incremental expansion:** +3x (current default)
- **Secular trend driven:** +5x (cloud, AI, security)
- **Paradigm shift:** +10x (rare: internet, mobile, AI)

## 🔮 RETRO-SCORING WITH NEW METHODOLOGY

**Estimated New Scores (if we applied new methodology):**

| Company | Current | Estimated New | Change | Rationale |
|---------|---------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **CRWD** | 40.8 | **52-55** | +12 | Category creator (+5), Track record (+4), NRR (+3) |
| **ZS** | 43.2 | **53-56** | +10 | Category creator (+5), Track record (+3), Scale (+2) |
| **DDOG** | 45.4 | **55-58** | +10 | Category creator (+5), Excellent NRR (+4), Track record (+3) |

**New Tier:** All three would move from **Moderate → Strong** tier (50-64)

**Validation:** Strong tier (50-64) better matches their exceptional returns (+326% to +778%).

---

## 💡 PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

### For Current Holdings

**Don't Sell CRWD, ZS, DDOG Based on Moderate Scores:**
- Scores underweight their strengths
- Track record + category leadership + SaaS metrics = underrated
- **Action:** HOLD or ADD on pullbacks

**Recognize Pattern:**
- Moderate score + exceptional returns = scoring blind spot
- Look for similar patterns in other moderate-tier companies
- **Check:** GTLB (40.2), SNOW (36.7), TTAN (39.9), KVYO (39.9)

### For Future IPO Evaluation

**Additional Due Diligence Questions:**

1. **Historical Execution:**
   - How many consecutive years of >50% growth?
   - Has the company hit guidance consistently?
   - Management team stability?

2. **Category Creation:**
   - Did they create a new category or compete in existing?
   - Are they the "category king"?
   - Is category expanding or mature?

3. **SaaS Metrics:**
   - Net Revenue Retention? (Target: >120%)
   - Gross Retention? (Target: >90%)
   - Subscription % of revenue? (Target: >95%)

4. **Scale Benefits:**
   - Are they reaching scale where winner-take-most kicks in?
   - Brand recognition? Market share leadership?

5. **Secular Trend:**
   - Riding a decade-long trend? (Cloud, AI, Security)
   - Or incremental improvement in mature market?

### For Databricks IPO (When It Happens)

**Apply New Framework:**

**Estimated Score with Current Methodology:** 60-65/100 (Strong)

**Estimated Score with New Methodology:** 70-75/100 (Very Strong)

**Why Higher:**
- Category Creator: Data Lakehouse (+5)
- Strong Track Record: 10+ years of growth (+4)
- Excellent SaaS Metrics: Likely >120% NRR (+4)
- Secular Trend: AI/ML data infrastructure (+3)
- Scale Benefits: $100B+ valuation (+7)

**Bonus:** +23 points → 70-75/100 (Very Strong, near Exceptional)

**Recommendation:** Even stronger buy thesis when considering execution factors.

## 🎯 FINAL TAKEAWAYS

### What We Learned:

1. **Current Score Methodology Has Blind Spots**
   - Underweights historical execution
   - Undervalues category creation
   - Doesn't explicitly reward SaaS metrics
   - Penalizes large market caps (but scale has advantages)

2. **CRWD, ZS, DDOG Success Not Random**
   - Category creators with 6-8 year track records
   - Excellent SaaS metrics (120-130% NRR)
   - Riding secular trends (cloud security, observability)
   - Scale advantages kicking in

3. **Score ≠ Return (Always)**
   - Execution matters as much as current metrics
   - Track record signals future performance
   - Category leadership compounds over time

### Recommendations:

**Short-Term (Don't Change Scoring Yet):**
- Recognize moderate scores can win big
- Don't sell CRWD, ZS, DDOG
- Look for similar patterns in other moderate-tier

**Medium-Term (Enhance Scoring):**
- Add "Execution Score" (15% weight)
- Explicitly score NRR, retention, category position
- Adjust TAM scoring for secular trends

**Long-Term (Build New Models):**
- Machine learning model trained on actual returns
- Factor in qualitative aspects (management, culture)
- Dynamic weighting based on company maturity

### The Paradox Resolved:

**Question:** Why do moderate scores produce exceptional returns?

**Answer:** Our scoring emphasizes **current metrics** (growth, margins, market share) over **historical execution** (track record, category creation, SaaS metrics).

**CRWD, ZS, DDOG prove:** Companies with exceptional historical execution, category leadership, and excellent SaaS metrics can deliver outsized returns even when current growth moderates.

**Investment Implication:** Don't ignore moderate-scored companies if they have:
- 5+ year track record of consistent execution
- Category creator or leader status
- Excellent SaaS metrics (120%+ NRR)
- Scale advantages (>$20B market cap)
- Riding secular trends

**These companies may be hidden gems that our current scoring system underrates.**
