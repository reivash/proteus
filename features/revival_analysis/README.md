# Phoenix Analyzer

**Status: Planning Phase**

Deep analysis system for identifying revival potential in beaten-down stocks.

## What It Will Do

Analyze stocks that have crashed (like Ubisoft) to determine:
- Is the decline technical or fundamental?
- What would trigger a revival?
- What's the probability and timeline of recovery?

## Analysis Dimensions (Planned)

1. **Technical Analysis** - Oversold indicators, support levels
2. **Fundamental Analysis** - Valuation vs peers, balance sheet health
3. **Sentiment Analysis** - News, social media, analyst coverage
4. **Catalyst Detection** - Earnings, M&A, management changes
5. **Institutional Analysis** - Fund flows, insider activity
6. **Macro Analysis** - Sector trends, economic factors
7. **Comparative Analysis** - Historical revival patterns
8. **Risk Assessment** - Bankruptcy risk, dilution risk
